1. Algorithm to Find Room EY128:
To locate room EY128, follow the room labels and directional arrows on the sign. Starting at the entrance near EY100, proceed in the direction of increasing room numbers. The algorithm follows these steps:

-Move right to EY102.
-Continue moving upward, passing through EY104, EY106, EY108, and so on.
-Follow this pattern until reaching EY128.
-This method ensures that the person systematically navigates the floor based on the provided signs.

2. Number of "Steps" to Find EY128:
A "step" is defined as a movement from one labeled room to the next. Each transition from one room to another counts as one step.

Moving from EY100 to EY102 is one step.
Moving from EY102 to EY104 is another step.
Since EY128 is reached after 15 such movements, it requires 15 steps in total.

3. Best-case, Worst-case, or Neither?
This is a worst-case scenario because it requires moving through 14 rooms before reaching EY128, taking a total of 15 steps.

4. Explaining Best-case and Worst-case Scenarios:
Worst-case scenario: The current situation, where the person must pass through multiple rooms (15 steps) before reaching EY128.

Best-case scenario: If the person takes the shortest available path based on the sign, they could reach EY128 in just 6 steps, significantly reducing travel time.

5. Improving the Algorithm After Memorizing the Layout:
Once the floor layout is memorized, the algorithm can be optimized by using the shortest path. Instead of taking the long route through EY100-EY130 (15 steps), the person can use the sign directing them through the shorter route (only 6 steps) to reach EY128 faster and more efficiently.
